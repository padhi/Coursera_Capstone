# Applied Data Science Capstone Project Using Python

## Introduction

 Location search has always been a huge headache, especially for business entrepreneurs  who is looking for finding the right location to start a new business specially, in dense urban areas where venues and merchants riddle every block.
 GPS might’ve solved the hassle of searching for nearby locations, but what about searching for locations that you’re not close to? For this, Google, Yelp, and other Foursquare competitors have continued to rely on user data entry (zip codes, street addresses) to return results. But Foursquare’s new Explore feature provides a visual solution to the problem, giving users the ability to search by vicinity with just a few quick finger taps.

## Business Problem

Finding and suggesting ideal location or neighborhood in the multicultural city of Toronto to open restaurants, yoga studios, bars, pharmacy or any other 
new business based on factors such as business venue, population density in the area, the demographics in the area, average income, proximity to other similar business venues.

## Audience

Business Entrepreneurs, Restaurant owners, Fitness Trainers, Retail store owners and small business owners seeking to establish new businesses in the city of Toronto neighborhoods.

## Solution

### Building a python application using "Foursquare" developers API

Based on GPS and other location signals, Foursquare could tell what business a user was visiting -- something no other company could do as reliably. That was a powerful tool, and it could be used to serve other businesses.

Using Foursquare developers API to pull Place Insights, a product that analyzes foot traffic trends from 93 million locations globally, information that can help a retailer decide where to set up a new store, say, or help a marketer know who is likely to use its brand. Foursquare also provides Pinpoint, a digital advertising system that helps brands target consumers based on where people go in real life.Foursquare  attribution helps advertisers answer their most pressing question: After someone sees a digital message, do they take action in the real world?

Ninety-two percent of commerce takes place in real life, not online. That means Google can tell you about only 8 percent of what everyone is doing with their spending habits. Foursquare aims to tell you about the other 92 percent. According to Asif Khan, founder of the Location Based Marketing Association, there are 5,000 businesses angling to profit from location intelligence; by 2019, total technology spend will reach $43 billion and advertisers will shell out $21 billion on location-based strategies.
